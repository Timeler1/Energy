# Energy Air Bot 2021
To set up the bot, first of all download python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
make sure to include pip (package installer) when installing python3
open the commandline and run: pip install selenium
execute the command: setx path "%path%;c:\directoryPath\chromedriver.exe" but replace the C:\directoryPath with the path to where you saved the folder.
open the ini.text file and set the path to your user data from chrome C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data (should look like this)
open chrome and open https://game.energy.ch/
log in and navigate, until the first question comes up
close chrome and run the python script
you'll see how the bot does the work for you, as soon as you win it will eventually stop or you'll simply get a text message on phone.


Disclaimer: I dont take any responsibility for what Energy might take as a counter measure. To use this Bot is against AGB and can get you banned from the competition and eventual wins can be removed (though i doubt they can detect it :D)
